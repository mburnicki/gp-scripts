# gp-scripts Collection

A collection of 'gnuplot' scripts that can be used to plot data
from various log file formats, e.g. the loopstats files created by ntpd.


## Installation

For information how to install these scripts, see:

https://wiki.py.meinberg.de/meinberg_support:using_git_repos_for_common_linux_scripts

The scripts should be run from a normal user accout. However, the
effective scripts will be located in `/usr/local/bin`, so `sudo` is required
for installation, which requires `root` permissions.
